Final Project Game Ideas:

Our final project will likely have a different, more cohesive theme yet we will reuse a lot of the existing elements of the current game. The cannon on the left side of the game will shoot bullets to take out the birds. Once a bird is hit, its falling trajectory will be tracked by the viewport and, when it lands at the bottom, it will do something exciting (e.g. explode). The "power meter" at the top of the screen is going to be used to generate the velocity of the bullets that are shot-- the more full the meter is, the faster the bullet will shoot. Perhaps really fast bullets will have the capability to power through multiple birds. Another game feature will encorporate the crab(s) that are walking across the bottom of the screen. When a bird is shot and falls, if it happens to land on the crab, a special mode will be engaged (e.g. continuous fire mode(?)). That part is TBD! The game will CONCLUDE once all birds have been shot. The actual sprite(s) and themes might change but the general actions will remain the same.
