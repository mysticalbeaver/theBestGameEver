Project description:
	In the game, a player is confined to the left hand side of the screen and is free to move up and down. Flying through the air are painted bird sprites, the foreground layer of which can be shot by the player to earn 1 point. There are also crab sprites scuttling across the bottom of the screen which when hit count as 5 points. The player can only go down the screen a certain amount so that you can not just sit at the bottom and shoot the crabs. Holding the space bar powers up the cannon and releasing it launches a projectile along a parabolic trajectory. This projectile uses per pixel collision detection to destroy the first sprite it contacts. The explosion has been turned into a strategy pattern so that the birds are able to explode using the chunking method and the crabs explode in a fiery ball. The game goes on for 1 minute at which point it automatically resets. God mode can be accessed by pressing the "g" key and will cause a projectile to not perform collision detection and thus just fly across the screen until it hits the ground. Since AI does not apply in our game, we chose to implement an object pool in place of this requirement. Each time a bird is "destroyed" it is placed in a separate vector which is not drawn to the screen so that when the game is reset we simply repopulate the vector of birds that are drawn with birds from this other vector.
