Final Project Game Ideas:

Our final project will likely have a different, more cohesive theme yet we will reuse a lot of the existing elements of the current game. The cannon on the left side of the game will shoot bullets along ballistic trajectories to take out the birds and crabs. The purpose of the flat sprites (walking along bottom) and flying sprites is such that hitting a flying sprite will on average be easier, since the missile spends more time at y>0 than at y=0, so destroying a flat sprite is worth more points than one of the flying sprites. The "power meter" at the top of the screen is going to be used to generate the velocity of the bullets that are shot-- the more full the meter is, the faster the bullet will shoot. Perhaps really fast bullets will have the capability to power through multiple birds. Another game feature will incorporate one special flying sprite. When this sprite is shot, it will explode releasing other "missiles" which will destroy any flying sprites or flat sprites that these missiles hit. Also instead of a "god mode" we will be able to toggle between no drag, linear drag, and quadratic drag forces on the missles as they are shot. The game will CONCLUDE after a predetermined interval of time (the number of sprites which are able to be hit by the missile should be large such that over this time interval we would not be able to destroy a significant amount of them). The actual sprite(s) and themes might change but the general actions will remain the same.
