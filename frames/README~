Project description: This project implements the tracker framework to follow a sprite in a world which is larger than the viewing screen. It also provides a means to cap the framerate at 60 fps through the xml. The two way multi-frame sprite comes in the form of a circling mew which changes color depending on the sign of its x-velocity. There is also a 2 way single frame sprite which changes its direction of flight according to the sign of its x-velocity and also does not travel in the y-direction just for effect. All sprites are stored polymorphically in a single vector as inherited classes of drawable. Finally, a frame factory is used to generate and store each frame of the world so that we don't have to make any of them more than once. Valgrind gives 3 errors, 2 of which do not appear to be in user code. These two are "invalid read of size 4" which research tells me comes from returning a pointer allocated within a framefactory::getFrame and framefactory::getFrames. The other error is "conditional jump depends on uninitialised value(s)" and I am not sure where exactly it is happening but is possibly from accessing unallocated memory in iOManager::loadAndSet.
